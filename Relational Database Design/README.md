Have you ever wanted to build a database but don't know where to start? This course will provide you a step-by-step guidance. We are going to start from a raw idea to an implementable relational database. Getting on the path, practicing the real-life mini cases, you will be confident and comfortable with Relational Database Design. Let's get started!

Relational Database Design can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Science in Data Science (MS-DS) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The MS-DS is an interdisciplinary degree that brings together faculty from CU Boulder’s departments of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Information Science, and others. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the MS-DS is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience in computer science, information science, mathematics, and statistics. Learn more about the MS-DS program at https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-science-data-science-boulder.

1. Introduction to DBMS, and Entity Relational Models: Introduce students to Database Management Systems. Introduce and train students with how to build conceptual entity relationship models.
2. Relational Models: Introduce the concepts about relational models. Train students with how to convert a conceptual entity relationship model to a relational model.
3. Normalization: Introduce students with the reasons and process of normalization. Train students with skills to normalize a relational model to 3NF.
4. Case Study: A summary of the knowledge we learned in this course, starting from an Entity Relationship Model to a Relational Model in 3NF and ready for implementation.
